Client-Server Architecture
1. machines are expensive, applications are complex
2. separate the application into two components
3. expensive workload can be done on the server
4. clients call servers to perform expensive tasks
5. remote procedure call (RPC) was born

Benefits of Client-Server Architecture
1. servers has beefy hardware
2. clients have commodity hardware
3. clients can still perform lightweight tasks
4. clients no longer require dependencies
5. however, we need a communication model

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model
- 7 layers each describe a specific networking component
- layer 7 - application - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- layer 6 - presentation - encoding/serialization
- layer 5 - session - connection establishment, TLS
- layer 4 - transport - TCP/UDP
- layer 3 - network - IP
- layer 2 - data link - Frames, MAC address (Ethernet)
- layer 1 - physical - electric signals, fiber or radio waves
